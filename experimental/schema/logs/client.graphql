#A client is defined as the initiator of a network connection for events
#    regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.
#
#    For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends the
#    SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator or requestor
#    in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator" to refer the
#    client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about the system
#    acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually populated
#    in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not populated for
#    packet-level events.
#
#    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which
#    is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls
#    in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled
#    appropriately.

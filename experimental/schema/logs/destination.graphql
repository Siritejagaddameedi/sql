#Destination fields capture details about the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These fields are populated from a network event, packet, or other event containing details of a network transaction.
#
#Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields. The source and destination fields are considered the baseline and should always be filled if an event contains source and destination details from a network transaction. If the event also contains identification of the client and server roles, then the client and server fields should also be populated.

    #        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
    #        the event was generated by the source.
    #
    #        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
    #        by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
